The objectives of the CNS course include bio-inspired neural modelling, spiking and reservoir computing neural networks, advanced computational neural models for learning, architectures and learning methods for dynamical/recurrent neural networks for temporal data and the analysis of their properties, the role of computational neuroscience in real-world applications (by case studies).

This repository stores the assignments, based on material from the laboratories' experience, to be delivered as the hands-on part of the exam.

### Lab 1
